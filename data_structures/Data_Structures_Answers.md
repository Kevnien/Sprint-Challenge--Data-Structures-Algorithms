Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?
    nlogn

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?
    n+logn to 2n

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?

5. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function?
    nlogn+n

6. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array?
    2n, if the input array was altered, the space complexity would be n but would add another n runtime complexity
